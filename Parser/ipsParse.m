function sample_data = ipsParse(filename, mode )
% ipsPARSE reads a folder with multiple.csv files from an IPS5 unit (ice profiling ADCP) 
% extracted via Ips5Extract v6.3.4 software.
%
% The raw dataset is converted into 3 types of CSV files; range,sensor,and wave separated by phases 
% (up to 12 phases, though 5 to 8 is common for ArcticNet moorings).
%
% Additionally, in the IPSdraft function, the estimated draft data is parsed out and added to the 
% sample_data struct which is passed back for QC
%
% Inputs:
%   filename  	- Cell array containing the name of the file to parse.
%   mode        - Toolbox data type mode ('profile' or 'timeSeries').
%
% Outputs:
%   sample_data - Struct containing imported sample data.
