function sample_data = AanderaaParse( filename, mode )
% AanderaaPARSE reads a tab delimited data file converted from the 5059 Data 
% reading program , for RCM4,7,11 and seaguard data loggers.
%
% This function is able to read in a single file retrieved from Aanderaa
% RCM4,7,11 and Seaguard data loggers generated using 
% 5059 Data Reading Program and directs the toolbox to either the 'rcm' or 
% 'seaguard' parsers. The pressure data is returned in a sample_data struct.
%
% Inputs:
%   filename    - Cell array containing the name of the file to parse.
%   mode        - Toolbox data type mode ('profile' or 'timeSeries').
%
% Outputs:
%   sample_data - Struct containing imported sample data.
